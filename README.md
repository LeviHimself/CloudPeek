## 🌦️ API

This app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

```

> The OpenWeatherMap API key used in this project is exposed in the client-side code. For demo and educational purposes, this is acceptable. For production or high-traffic apps, consider using a backend proxy to keep your API key secure.
